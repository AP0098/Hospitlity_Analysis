**Problem Statment **

One of the top telecom companies in India, AtliQo, debuted their 5G plans in May 2022 alongside other carriers.

But once 5G launched in May 2022, the management saw a drop in their active users and revenue growth. The business director of Atliqo asked their analytics team to submit a study comparing KPIs from the pre- and post-5G launch periods. The management is eager to assess how things performed during these times in order to gain knowledge that will help them decide how best to restore their active user rate and other important KPIs. They also want to know if they can obtain more active users by optimizing their internet plans. This work is given to junior data analyst Peter Pandey.
